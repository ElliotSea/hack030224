        "review title": "Excellent product.",
        "review contents": "I had a MacBook Pro i7 16, and I decided to change for the M3, and in general I see great significant changes in performance and processing. The focus is more on software development, which is my job. Although I have seen many reviews, regarding its predecessors such as the M1 and M2 I would think that if you think about changing for this one, it is better to wait a bit since the change is not so big. But if you have a MacBook Pro with intel processors, I do recommend making the switch. At least in terms of development it is excellent, as long as you opt for this M3 version with 16 ram. I have been using it for 2 months now and everything is normal in relation to the battery, very demanding in performance. I could not say much for other areas such as design or video, but it is a great option."

        "review contents": "Don’t buy from this company. They didn’t honor refunding this purchased. The product received required a call to Apple Support. According to Apple Support the unit had a bad hard drive and recommended replacing it since it was < 6 days old. There is nowhere in the universe the consumer is responsible for a manufactured defect despite the seller.\n\nThis seller partially refunded the amount but still owes me over $500 and would not respond to my emails. I just started my small business and I bought this laptop for my business. I am still owed a substantial amount of funds. I do not recommend this seller. I have since purchased this exact MacBook from the Apple Store and it is an amazing machine."
